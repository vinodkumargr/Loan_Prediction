# Loan_Prediction
Loan Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at building a model to predict the likelihood of a loan application being approved. The goal is to help financial institutions make informed decisions about loan approval by using historical loan data to train the model.

The model is built using a supervised learning algorithm, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests, on a dataset that includes information about the loan applicants, such as their income, employment history, credit score, and loan amount requested. The model will learn patterns in the data and use these patterns to make predictions about new loan applications.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions about the outcome of new loan applications. This information can be used by financial institutions to help make decisions about loan approval, which can help to reduce the risk of default and improve the overall efficiency of the loan approval process.

The project includes the following steps:

1. Data acquisition and pre-processing
2. Exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between the variables and the outcome
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Deployment of the model to make predictions about new loan applications.
5. The results of the project can be used to improve the loan approval process and help financial institutions make more informed decisions about loan approval. The code, dataset, and documentation for the project are available on GitHub, allowing other developers and researchers to build upon and extend the work.

I have trained very basic model with a small dataaset. Soory If it will make wrong predictions.
